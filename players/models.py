Model objects.
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data.
It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing.
Generally, each model maps to a single database table
The basics:
    * Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
    * Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
    * With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API; see [Making queries](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/).
